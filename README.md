# Photography Portfolio Website

A photography portfolio website that will feature and showcase his/her work to potential customers and employers. 
UX and content of the website focuses on B2C principles, making the website look transparent and emotionally appealing to buyer decision making. 

## UX
 
Site owner’s goal:
- Showcasing his photography work.
- Make his photography appear professional and his offer of service interesting  to the public eye.
- Emphasize quality and uniqueness of service to distinguish it from other competitors on the market. 

I want to use Hierarchical Tree Structure, as it is a standard structure which reduces complexity, as B2C model is my main concern. 
Therefore it will by default make it more transparent and easy to use. Keeping all the action that can be undertaken on a website by a consumer on less than three clicks away. 
To resolve the navigation problem on mobile I will use the “burger icon”. What I aim to achieve is a transparent look of the website, that covers all of the owner’s goals. 
Also I will be exploiting the B2C model to the fullest of my ability, by keeping the design unique, and by making it stand out among competition. 
It needs to be catchy and I must not overload the website with unnecessary content.

### Features Left to Implement
- For future features I plan to upgrade the hero image background. 
I will put a single background, and 3 png cropped images of the photographer and some other items.
I will add parallax effect making them appear and disappear as the user scrolls down and up the page content. 
This can be achieved by playing with gradient and content background colors. 
Also I wiil work on navigation bar design, to give more animation and make it even more responsive and modern.
